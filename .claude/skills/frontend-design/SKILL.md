# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop". Implement functional code with exceptional attention to aesthetic detail and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build, possibly including context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

### 1. Purpose
- What problem does this interface solve?
- Who uses it?

### 2. Tone
Pick an extreme:
- Brutally minimal
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Organic/natural
- Luxury/refined
- Playful/toy-like
- Editorial/magazine
- Brutalist/raw
- Art deco/geometric
- Soft/pastel
- Industrial/utilitarian

**CRITICAL:** Pick a clear conceptual direction and execute precisely. Both bold maximalism and refined minimalism work — the key is intentionality, not intensity.

### 3. Constraints
- Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)

### 4. Differentiation
- What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?
- What's the single detail someone will remember?

## Frontend Aesthetic Guidelines

Focus on:

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- **AVOID:** Arial, Inter, and generic fonts
- **PREFER:** Distinctive, characterful choices that elevate the aesthetic
- Pair an unusual display font with a refined body font

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents beat timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: a well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry
- Overlapping
- Diagonal flow
- Elements that break the grid
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth instead of default solid colors
- Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic
- Apply creative shapes:
  - Gradient meshes
  - Noise textures
  - Geometric patterns
  - Layered transparencies
  - Dramatic shadows
  - Decorative borders
  - Custom cursors
  - Grain overlays

## What to NEVER Do

**NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- Cliché font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Predictable color schemes (especially purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layout and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design without context-specific character

## Critical Principles

1. **Interpret creatively** and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context

2. **No two designs should be alike** — vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics

3. **NEVER converge** on common choices (like Space Grotesk) across generations

4. **Implement functional code** that is:
   - Production-grade and functional
   - Visually stunning and memorable
   - Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point of view
   - Meticulously polished in every detail

5. **Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision:**
   - Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
   - Minimalist/refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
   - Elegance comes from well-executed vision

## Final Message

**Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back — show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and fully committing to a distinctive vision.**
